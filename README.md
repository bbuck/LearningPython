# SimpleModel

This project contains one (main)  file, `model.py` which contains one class of use: `Model`.

Additional files `person.py` and `model_test.py` are for sample usage of this Model class. 

This is simplistic pymongo-dependant Model for Modeling DB data structures in Python with PyMongo.

The purpose of this file is to advance my knowledge in Python (as of initial commit this is my first week of Python) and simplify some upcoming work in the 10gen Mongo for Developers course (M101) at [education.10gen.com](http://education.10gen.com).

Feel free to fork and make pull requests and critique my work. If I've done something wrong or improperly I'm willing to learn more about what I've done.

Additional files `person.py` and `model_test.py` are for sample usage of this Model class.
